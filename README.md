### 🚀 About Me

I'm actively rebuilding my foundation in frontend development—focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js.  
My mission is simple: **build real, useful projects while mastering my craft**.

Right now, I'm combining academic learning with self-driven, deep practice—pushing code daily, studying strategy, and sharpening my mind like a blade.

I believe in long-term thinking, deliberate action, and facing the hard stuff head-on.
